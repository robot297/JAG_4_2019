/**
 *

 A first prototype of a program that plays a simplified version of the children's card
 game Go Fish against you.  This version is based from the rules given at

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Fish

 "Seven cards are dealt from a standard 52-card deck to each player.
 The remaining cards are spread out in a disorderly pile referred to as the "pool".
 The player whose turn it is to play asks another player for his or her cards of a
 particular face value. For example Alice may ask, "Bob, do you have any threes?"
 Alice must have at least one card of the rank she requested. Bob must hand
 over all cards of that rank if possible. If he has none, Bob tells Alice to "go fish"
 and Alice draws a card from the pool and places it in her own hand.

 Then it is the next player's turn â€“ unless the card Alice drew is the card she asked for,
 in which case she shows it to the other players, and she gets another turn. When any player at
 any time has all four cards of one face value, it forms a book, and the cards must be placed
 face up in front of that player.

 Play proceeds to the left. When all sets of cards have been laid down in books, the game ends.
 The player with the most books wins."


 Your tasks: finish the incomplete methods. Run and test the program. Also run the unit tests.
 You might want to add some extra System.out.println() statements to update the player on the status of the game.
